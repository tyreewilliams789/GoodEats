                  <td>Thai Coconut Curry Noodle Soup</td>
                  <td>Place noodles in a shallow baking dish and boil enough water to just cover them. While water is boiling, prep the shallot, garlic, lemongrass, red bell pepper, then get all other ingredients ready by the stove.
                    In a medium pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add shallot and lemongrass. Saute until fragrant and golden, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, saute 1-2 mintues. Add red curry paste. Saute for 1-2 minutes. Add the coconut milk , chicken broth and kefir lime leaves and bring to a simmer, stirring. Once gently simmering add the bell pepper, fish sauce, sugar, soy sauce and chili garlic sauce.
                    Add the prawns ( or chicken or tofu)  and gently simmer until cooked. Give a generous squeeze of lime. Taste, adding more lime/salt/ red curry paste if necessary.
                    Drain the noodles. If serving the soup immediately, toss the noodles right into the pot and then serve.
                    Alternatively, divide noodles into the bowls and ladel the flavorful soup over top.
                    Garnish with fresh basil, bean sprouts, thinly sliced red onion and chopped scallions.</td>

                  <td>Preheat oven to 375F
                    Make the Walnut Chorizo. Place walnuts, spices, salt and tomato paste in a food processor and pulse until it is the texture of course sand. Add a tablespoon of water, and pulse again, until just combined. Set aside.
                    Line a ½ sheet pan ( 13 x 18 inches) with parchment paper. Cover with tortilla chips. Drizzle chips with a little hot sauce. Spread out small spoonfuls of refried beans over top. Sprinkle with the cheese and spread out the walnut chorizo. Place in the oven until warmed through and cheese is melted, about 10- 12 minutes. While baking prep your garnishes. 
                    When cheese is melty, sprinkle with the tomatoes, cilantro, radishes, avocado, cilantro and any other garnishes you like.</td>

                    Pour chicken broth into baking dish (to help the peppers steam) and cover with foil.
                    Bake until peppers are tender, 55 minutes to 1 hour. Uncover and broil 2 minutes.

                  <td>In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook linguine according to package directions until al dente. Set aside ½ cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and set aside.
                    In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Sprinkle flour over evenly, then stir and cook until mixture is lightly golden. 
                    Very gradually add broth in while whisking, 2 tablespoons at a time, waiting for mixture to become completely smooth before adding more broth. Bring mixture to a boil, then gradually stream in milk while whisking. Bring to a simmer and cook until sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                    Remove from heat and add Parmesan and yogurt, if using. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. 
                    Add pasta and a 1/4 cup reserved pasta water to sauce and toss to combine. If sauce is too thick add more pasta water, a tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency.

                  <td>Cauliflower Grilled Cheese</td>
                  <td>Cut cauliflower into florets. Process cauliflower florets in a food processor until the texture resembles rice. Alternatively, you can grate the cauliflower.
                    In a medium bowl, combine processed cauliflower, eggs, Parmesan and oregano. Mix until evenly combined then season with salt and pepper.
                    Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Spray with cooking spray then scoop the cauliflower mixture into a small patty on one side of the pan. Repeat to form a second patty on the other side. (These are your “bread” slices.) Press down on both pieces with a spatula and cook until golden underneath, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until the other sides are golden, about 3 minutes more.
                    Top one cauliflower slice with cheese then place the other cauliflower slice on top. Cook until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes more per side. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</td>
